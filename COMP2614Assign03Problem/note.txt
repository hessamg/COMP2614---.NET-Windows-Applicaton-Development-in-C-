use .split method (.split('|') and then .split(':'))
each line is one invoice
validation is not a requirement (do it if you have time) and the information provided is only for formating 
think about how to structure the classes
for example have a class for header and another class for invoices
dont forget to convert numerics to decimals so you can process them
